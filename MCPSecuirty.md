--Introduction
In a very short period, the action-oriented capabilities of LLMs (not just text-to-text generation) have been gaining momentum. Enterprises are rapidly adopting agentic capabilities to boost productivity and reduce costs. This shift began with the introduction of LLM function calling, where LLMs can invoke APIs—opening immense opportunities for enterprise use cases.
Developers can now create AI agents using orchestration frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex, which offer standardized ways to integrate external services with LLMs. However, integration approaches vary significantly across platforms, especially when compared to OpenAI's function calling mechanism.
Example:
In ChatGPT, functions/tools are declared using JSON schema and automatically exposed.
In the OpenAI API, developers must manually define tools with strict schemas and handle input/output formatting and the same is true with Gemeni or Anthropic.
In LangChain, LangGraph, and other frameworks, additional abstractions may conflict with OpenAI’s native expectations.

As a result, developers often need to create redundant implementations or wrappers for each SDK or platform. While the ecosystem is evolving rapidly, developers still have to write integration logic in proprietary ways. Each developer approaches external service integration differently—leading to fragmentation.
For instance, connecting to a database is a common integration task, yet each implementation is isolated. One developer may prioritize secure connections, while another may overlook it. This lack of consistency creates a strong need for standardized interfaces to improve reusability and reduce effort duplication.

To address this, Anthropic has introduced the Model Context Protocol (MCP) an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. With MCP developers need not be learn diffrent schema, No redududancy for each provider and can manage state and error handling.

--Why SDL is key for MCP security

### MCP servers run as separate processes
Each server has its own security context
    weather_server = MCPServer("weather")  # Process 1
    db_server = MCPServer("database")      # Process 2
    file_server = MCPServer("filesystem")  # Process 3

Each process needs:
- Proper sandboxing
- Resource limits
- Access controls
- Secure communication channels

SDL ensures each server process is hardened against:
-Resource exhaustion attacks
-Privilege escalation
-Inter-process communication vulnerabilities
-Memory corruption issues

There are  multiple trust boundaries which needs to be consider:
<<TO-DO>>

SDL provides opputunity to address:
-Secure communication protocols
-Input validation at each boundary
-Proper authentication/authorization

Protocol discovery feature Issue:
# Clients discover capabilities at runtime
available_tools = await client.list_tools()
available_resources = await client.list_resources()

# Security questions:
# - Can malicious servers expose dangerous capabilities?
# - How do we validate tool/resource safety?
# - What if a server lies about its capabilities?

SDL addresses this through:
-Capability validation frameworks
-Allowlist/blocklist mechanisms
-Runtime security monitoring
-Secure capability attestation

Communication Threats:
# Server can push notifications to client
await server.send_notification({
    "method": "alert",
    "params": {"message": "System compromised!"}
})

# Security risks:
- Malicious notifications
- Denial of service attacks
- Information disclosure
- Social engineering attacks

# SDL mitigates these through:
-Notification validation
-Rate limiting
-Content filtering
-Client-side security policies

# Persistent State Security:
MCP servers maintain state, creating new attack vectors:
# Security concerns:
- State corruption attacks
- Session hijacking
- Cache poisoning
- Memory exhaustion

# Resource specific threats 
MCP's resource abstraction requires careful access control

# Resources can expose sensitive data
resources = [
    "file:///etc/passwd",           # System files
    "db://production/users",        # Database tables
    "api://internal/admin",         # Internal APIs
]

# SDL requirements:
- Principle of least privilege
- Resource access auditing
- URI validation and sanitization
- Runtime permission checks

# Transport Security Issue
Different transports, different risks
transports = {
    "stdio": "Local process communication",
    "http": "Network-based, needs TLS",
    "websocket": "Persistent connections, authentication",
    "tcp": "Raw sockets, custom encryption",
    "ipc": "Inter-process communication"
}
SDL ensures:
-Transport-specific security controls
-Encryption in transit
-Authentication mechanisms
-Certificate validation

# Third-Party Server Risks
MCP enables third-party server integration
# Third-party MCP servers
servers = [
    "github.com/company/weather-mcp",
    "dropbox.com/drive",
]

# Security concerns:
- Supply chain attacks
- Malicious servers
- Vulnerable dependencies
- Backdoors and trojans

#### SDL addresses this through:
Server validation and signing
Dependency scanning
Runtime behavior monitoring
Sandboxing untrusted servers

# Compliance and Auditing
Requires comprehensive security auditing

# Design Phase
Threat modeling for each MCP component
Security architecture review
Trust boundary analysis
Attack surface assessment

# Implementation Phase
Secure coding standards
Input validation frameworks
Error handling protocols
Logging and monitoring

# Testing Phase
Penetration testing
Fuzzing of JSON-RPC endpoints
Process isolation validation
Resource access testing

# Deployment Phase
Secure configuration management
Runtime security monitoring
Incident response procedures
Security update mechanisms


SDL is critical for MCP deployment because MCP shifts the LLMs stateless interaction of services to stateful, making it bi-directional and dynamic. It provides flexibility but at the same time make the attack surface more wider.

# MCP Security: Why SDL is Critical

## Introduction

In a very short period, the action-oriented capabilities of LLMs (not just text-to-text generation) have been gaining momentum. Enterprises are rapidly adopting agentic capabilities to boost productivity and reduce costs. This shift began with the introduction of LLM function calling, where LLMs can invoke APIs—opening immense opportunities for enterprise use cases.

Developers can now create AI agents using orchestration frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex, which offer standardized ways to integrate external services with LLMs. However, integration approaches vary significantly across platforms, especially when compared to OpenAI's function calling mechanism.

### Examples of Platform Differences

- **ChatGPT**: Functions/tools are declared using JSON schema and automatically exposed
- **OpenAI API**: Developers must manually define tools with strict schemas and handle input/output formatting (same applies to Gemini and Anthropic)
- **LangChain/LangGraph**: Additional abstractions may conflict with OpenAI's native expectations

![Integration Complexity](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eef21ead-18a9-45ab-b006-561cae4ec8a1)

As a result, developers often need to create redundant implementations or wrappers for each SDK or platform. While the ecosystem is evolving rapidly, developers still have to write integration logic in proprietary ways. Each developer approaches external service integration differently—leading to fragmentation.

For instance, connecting to a database is a common integration task, yet each implementation is isolated. One developer may prioritize secure connections, while another may overlook it. This lack of consistency creates a strong need for standardized interfaces to improve reusability and reduce effort duplication.

To address this, Anthropic has introduced the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**—an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. With MCP, developers:
- Don't need to learn different schemas
- Eliminate redundancy for each provider
- Can manage state and error handling consistently

## What is MCP and Its Architecture

## Why SDL is Key for MCP Security

### 1. Process Isolation Challenges

**MCP servers run as separate processes**, each with its own security context:

```python
weather_server = MCPServer("weather")     # Process 1
db_server = MCPServer("database")         # Process 2
file_server = MCPServer("filesystem")     # Process 3
```

**Each process needs:**
- Proper sandboxing
- Resource limits
- Access controls
- Secure communication channels

**SDL ensures each server process is hardened against:**
- Resource exhaustion attacks
- Privilege escalation
- Inter-process communication vulnerabilities
- Memory corruption issues

### 2. Multiple Trust Boundaries

There are multiple trust boundaries which need to be considered:

```
AI Client (High Trust)
    ↕️ JSON-RPC Protocol
Transport Layer (Medium Trust)
    ↕️ Process Boundaries
MCP Servers (Variable Trust)
    ↕️ Network/File/DB Access
External Systems (Low Trust)
```

**SDL provides opportunities to address:**
- Secure communication protocols
- Input validation at each boundary
- Proper authentication/authorization

### 3. Dynamic Protocol Discovery Issues

**The Problem:**
```python
# Clients discover capabilities at runtime
available_tools = await client.list_tools()
available_resources = await client.list_resources()
```

**Security Questions:**
- Can malicious servers expose dangerous capabilities?
- How do we validate tool/resource safety?
- What if a server lies about its capabilities?

**SDL addresses this through:**
- Capability validation frameworks
- Allowlist/blocklist mechanisms
- Runtime security monitoring
- Secure capability attestation

### 4. Bidirectional Communication Threats

**The Risk:**
```python
# Server can push notifications to client
await server.send_notification({
    "method": "alert",
    "params": {"message": "System compromised!"}
})
```

**Security Risks:**
- Malicious notifications
- Denial of service attacks
- Information disclosure
- Social engineering attacks

**SDL mitigates these through:**
- Notification validation
- Rate limiting
- Content filtering
- Client-side security policies

### 5. Persistent State Security

MCP servers maintain state, creating new attack vectors:

**Security Concerns:**
- State corruption attacks
- Session hijacking
- Cache poisoning
- Memory exhaustion

### 6. Resource-Specific Threats

MCP's resource abstraction requires careful access control:

```python
# Resources can expose sensitive data
resources = [
    "file:///etc/passwd",           # System files
    "db://production/users",        # Database tables
    "api://internal/admin",         # Internal APIs
]
```

**SDL Requirements:**
- Principle of least privilege
- Resource access auditing
- URI validation and sanitization
- Runtime permission checks

### 7. Transport Security Issues

Different transports present different risks:

```python
transports = {
    "stdio": "Local process communication",
    "http": "Network-based, needs TLS",
    "websocket": "Persistent connections, authentication",
    "tcp": "Raw sockets, custom encryption",
    "ipc": "Inter-process communication"
}
```

**SDL ensures:**
- Transport-specific security controls
- Encryption in transit
- Authentication mechanisms
- Certificate validation

### 8. Third-Party Server Risks

MCP enables third-party server integration:

```python
# Third-party MCP servers
servers = [
    "github.com/company/weather-mcp",
    "dropbox.com/drive",
]
```

**Security Concerns:**
- Supply chain attacks
- Malicious servers
- Vulnerable dependencies
- Backdoors and trojans

**SDL addresses this through:**
- Server validation and signing
- Dependency scanning
- Runtime behavior monitoring
- Sandboxing untrusted servers

### 9. Compliance and Auditing

MCP requires comprehensive security auditing capabilities to maintain security posture and meet regulatory requirements.

## Conclusion

SDL is critical for MCP deployment because MCP shifts LLMs from stateless interaction with services to stateful, making it bidirectional and dynamic. While this provides tremendous flexibility and capabilities, it simultaneously makes the attack surface much wider.

The complexity introduced by MCP—including persistent state, process isolation, dynamic discovery, and bidirectional communication—requires a comprehensive security approach that can only be achieved through proper SDL implementation throughout the entire development lifecycle.

Without SDL, MCP's powerful features become significant security vulnerabilities that could compromise AI systems, expose sensitive data, or enable attacks against connected infrastructure.
