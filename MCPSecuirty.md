--Introduction
In a very short period, the action-oriented capabilities of LLMs (not just text-to-text generation) have been gaining momentum. Enterprises are rapidly adopting agentic capabilities to boost productivity and reduce costs. This shift began with the introduction of LLM function calling, where LLMs can invoke APIs—opening immense opportunities for enterprise use cases.
Developers can now create AI agents using orchestration frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex, which offer standardized ways to integrate external services with LLMs. However, integration approaches vary significantly across platforms, especially when compared to OpenAI's function calling mechanism.
Example:
In ChatGPT, functions/tools are declared using JSON schema and automatically exposed.
In the OpenAI API, developers must manually define tools with strict schemas and handle input/output formatting.
In LangChain, LangGraph, and other frameworks, additional abstractions may conflict with OpenAI’s native expectations.

As a result, developers often need to create redundant implementations or wrappers for each SDK or platform. While the ecosystem is evolving rapidly, developers still have to write integration logic in proprietary ways. Each developer approaches external service integration differently—leading to fragmentation.
For instance, connecting to a database is a common integration task, yet each implementation is isolated. One developer may prioritize secure connections, while another may overlook it. This lack of consistency creates a strong need for standardized interfaces to improve reusability and reduce effort duplication.

To address this, Anthropic has introduced the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. MCP enables consistent, scalable integrations, making it easier to implement complex workflows and AI agents across a wide range of enterprise use cases.
